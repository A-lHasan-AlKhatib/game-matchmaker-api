## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-lHasan-AlKhatib/game-matchmaker-api.git
   cd game-matchmaker-api
   ```

2. **Create a ****`.env`**** file** in the project root:

   ```dotenv
   PORT==****
   DB_HOST=****
   DB_PORT==****
   DB_NAME==****
   DB_USERNAME==****
   DB_PASSWORD==****
   ```

3. **Verify the Dockerfile** and ensure the service binary is built at `/app/main`.
